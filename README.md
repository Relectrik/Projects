## Academic Projects

- CMSI2120 (Data Structures) Homework 3: Utilizes a prefix trie and recursion to implement an autocomplete feature.

---

- CMSI2130 (Algorithnms & Analysis) Homework 1: Utilizes A\* search to find optimal path within a maze with multiple goal states and uniform cost.

- CMSI2130 (Algorithnms & Analysis) Homework 2: Utilizes alphabeta pruning and Adversarial search to decide best possible move against an optimal opponent.

- CMSI2130 (Algorithnms & Analysis) Homework 3: Utilizes dynamic programming to guess a secret word using edit distance and a list of top-down transformations to turn one string into another. Useful in real life circumstances when spell-checking.

- CMSI2130 (Algorithnms & Analysis) Homework 4: Utilizes Huffman Encoding and Decoding to reduce size of files aka compression

- CMSI2130 (Algorithnms & Analysis) Homework 5: CSPs -- Utilizes Arc and Node consistency to satisfy constraints associated with meeting times

---

- CMSI3300 (Artificial Intelligence) Homework 1: Utilizing Propositional Logic and use of KnowledgeBase for inference testing to navigate a BlindBot through a maze of pits.

## Personal Projects

- Smart-Calendar: Current work-in-progress passion project that automatically and intelligently gives you a scheduled calendar with to-dos depending on your preferences. Back-end and algorithmic/AI focused.
