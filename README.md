## Academic Projects

- CMSI2120 (Data Structures) Homework 3: Utilizes a prefix trie and recursion to implement an autocomplete feature.

---

- CMSI2130 (Algorithnms & Analysis) Homework 1: Utilizes A\* search to find optimal path within a maze with multiple goal states and uniform cost.

- CMSI2130 (Algorithnms & Analysis) Homework 2: Utilizes alphabeta pruning and Adversarial search to decide best possible move against an optimal opponent.

- CMSI2130 (Algorithnms & Analysis) Homework 3: Utilizes dynamic programming to guess a secret word using edit distance and a list of top-down transformations to turn one string into another. Useful in real life circumstances when spell-checking.

- CMSI2130 (Algorithnms & Analysis) Homework 4: Utilizes Huffman Encoding and Decoding to reduce size of files aka compression

- CMSI2130 (Algorithnms & Analysis) Homework 5: CSPs -- Utilizes Arc and Node consistency to satisfy constraints associated with meeting times

- CMSI3300 (Artificial Intelligence) Homework 1: Utilizing Propositional Logic and use of KnowledgeBase for inference testing to navigate a BlindBot through a maze of pits. Worked with [**Aidan Bryce Dionisio**].

- CMSI3300 (Artificial Intelligence) Homework 2: Utilizing Bayesian Networks, Maximum Expected Utility and Value of Perfect Information to make intelligent decisions given a set of probabilities within a system. Worked with [**Aidan Bryce Dionisio**].

## Personal Projects

- Smart-Calendar: Current work-in-progress passion project that automatically and intelligently gives you a scheduled calendar with to-dos depending on your preferences. Back-end and algorithmic/AI focused.

- Recoup App: Project done during Hackathon on 04/15/2023: https://github.com/Relectrik/RecoupApp

- Java-Basic-Blockchain: Heavily adapted from tutorial: https://medium.com/programmers-blockchain/creating-your-first-blockchain-with-java-part-2-transactions-2cdac335e0ce [**CREDIT TO CODER KASS**]. Bare-bones block chain that implements transactions between users utilizing Java OOP.

- Python-Intro-CNN: UNTRAINED Convolutional Neural Network that reads the MNIST database of images. Heavily adapted from tutorial: https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/ [**CREDIT TO VICTOR ZHOU**]. Basic implementation of CNN, however untrained and no backpropogation meaning only ~10% accuracy on predictions.
