Sure, here are the projects sorted alphabetically by title:

## Projects
Title | Description | Personal/Academic |
|---|---|---|
| [Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Anomaly-Detection) | Extracted and cleaned data from huggingface dataset. Used SDV's library to generate synthetic data to then introduce intentional anomalies. Experimented with Scikit learn's IsolationForest by playing around with contamination rates. | **Personal** |
| [Automated Gym Routine](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Automated-Gym-Routine) | Self-motivated project that can return a routine for you with set volumes, reps in range of concentric failure, weight and progression over time based on Renaissance Hypertrophy's ideals. Utilizes Propositional Logic in a knowledge base to query for soreness levels of mzuscles, and a simple soreness aggregator heuristic to calculate volume for next workout. | **Personal** |
| [A* Search](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Academic%20Projects/CMSI2130/HW1) | Utilizes A* search to find optimal path within a maze with multiple goal states and uniform cost. | **Academic** // Algorithms & Analysis |
| [Autocomplete](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Academic%20Projects/CMSI2120/HW3/homework3-Relectrik) | Utilizes a prefix trie and recursion to implement an autocomplete feature. | **Academic** // Data Structures & Applications|
| [Bayesian Decision Making](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Academic%20Projects/CMSI3300/HW2) | Utilizing Bayesian Networks, Maximum Expected Utility and Value of Perfect Information to make intelligent decisions given a set of probabilities within a system. Worked with [Aidan Bryce Dionisio](https://github.com/GamerNerd-i). | **Academic** // Artificial Intelligence |
| [Blindbot](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Academic%20Projects/CMSI3300/HW1) | Utilizing Propositional Logic and use of KnowledgeBase for inference testing to navigate a BlindBot through a maze of pits. Worked with [Aidan Bryce Dionisio](https://github.com/GamerNerd-i). | **Academic** // Artificial Intelligence |
| [DCGAN on LoL Champion Icons](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/DCGAN-LoL-Champs) | Utilizes Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network to replicate League of Legends Champion Icons taken from the Riot's API. | **Personal** |
| [Distle](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Academic%20Projects/CMSI2130/HW3) | Utilizes dynamic programming to guess a secret word using edit distance and a list of top-down transformations to turn one string into another. Useful in real life circumstances when spell-checking. | **Academic** // Algorithms & Analysis |
| [Huffman Tries](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Academic%20Projects/CMSI2130/HW4) | Utilizes Huffman Encoding and Decoding to compress size of files. | **Academic** // Algorithms & Analysis |
| [Meeting Scheduling](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Academic%20Projects/CMSI2130/HW5) | Utilizes Arc and Node consistency to satisfy constraints associated with meeting times. | **Academic** // Algorithms & Analysis |
| [Pac-man Particle Filtering](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Academic%20Projects/CMSI3300/HW3) | Utilizing Hidden Markov Models, to take advantage of particle filtering and noise emissions to solve a UC Berkeley Pacman problem by leveraging sklearn. Worked with [Aidan Bryce Dionisio](https://github.com/GamerNerd-i). | **Academic** // Artificial Intelligence |
| [Recoup](https://github.com/Relectrik/RecoupApp) | Project done during a full-day hackathon in April 2023. Replit server is currently down so API call is not working at the moment. | **Personal** |
| [Smart Calendar](https://github.com/Relectrik/Smart-Calendar) | Current work-in-progress passion project that automatically and intelligently gives you a scheduled calendar with to-dos depending on your preferences. Back-end and algorithmic/AI focused. | **Personal** |
| [Tic-Tac-Total](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Academic%20Projects/CMSI2130/HW2) | Utilizes alphabeta pruning and Adversarial search to decide best possible move against an optimal opponent. | **Academic** // Algorithms & Analysis |
| [Toxicity & Salary Predictors using ML](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Academic%20Projects/CMSI3300/HW4) | Utilizing data files to make predictions on wikipedia comments, and salary with neural networks by leveraging preprocessing methods in sklearn's toolkit. Worked with [Aidan Bryce Dionisio](https://github.com/GamerNerd-i). | **Academic** // Artificial Intelligence |
| [Valorant Role Predictor](https://github.com/Relectrik/Projects/tree/main/Personal%20Projects/Valorant-Role-Predictor) | Trains on current ability icons and associated agent's roles as labels to then predict the role of another ability based on its icon. | **Personal** |
